Using Sage\TeX, one can use Sage to compute things and put them into
your \LaTeX{}  document. For example, there are
$\sage{number_of_partitions(1234)} $ integer partitions of $1234$.
You don't need to compute the number yourself, or even cut and paste
it from somewhere.

The second derivative of $f$ is

\begin{align}
  \frac{ \mathrm{ d} ^{ 2} } { \mathrm{ d} x^{ 2} }  \sage{f(x)}  =
  \sage{diff(f, x, 2)(x)} .
\end{align}

Have seen several analysis specifications (stability/performance).

\spa{1} All formulated in terms of matrix inequalities.

\spa{1} Try to achieve them by designing a controller.

In a tracking problem, a major emphasis is laid on shaping the sensitivity (reference to tracking error), under
the constraint that the control effort (reference to control) does not peak too much and rolls off at high frequencies. In view of this rough specs,
consider

which indicates the relevant performance signals.

Choose a low-pass scalar weighting function $w_1$ and a constant or high-pass weight $w_2$. Define $W_1=w_1I$ and
$W_2=w_2I$ and consider the following interconnection with weighted performance channels:

% \cen{\includegraphics[scale=.6]{../logo_ctut.pdf}}

Then design a controller $K$ which stabilizes this interconnection and minimizes
the $\Hi$-norm of $d\to e=\text{col}(e_1,e_2)$.
